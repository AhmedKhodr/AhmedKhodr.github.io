        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate individual with a love for technology and creativity. From a young age, I found myself drawn to various forms of art and expression, which eventually led me to pursue a career in <em>web development</em>. I believe that combining my artistic skills with technical knowledge allows me to create engaging and functional websites that serve a purpose</p>
        <p> Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in nature and exploring new places. Traveling not only broadens my horizons but also inspires my work. I often find that experiences in different cultures enrich my understanding and creativity. As I continue my journey, I strive to learn and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
